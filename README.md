# TechGyant Insights - Investor Recommendation System

**Project**: AI-powered African startup recommendation system for tech investors

## Overview
TechGyant Insights uses linear regression to predict investor readiness scores for African tech startups based on **real data extracted from TechGyant articles**, founder backgrounds, and market alignment data. The system automatically scrapes and updates data from the TechGyant website to ensure predictions are based on the latest startup information.

## Features
- **Real TechGyant Data**: Automatically extracted from TechGyant website articles
- **Linear Regression Model**: Predicts startup investment readiness scores
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful signals from startup data
- **FastAPI Endpoint**: RESTful API for real-time predictions
- **Data Visualization**: Comprehensive analysis and model performance plots
- **Model Comparison**: Linear Regression vs Decision Trees vs Random Forest
- **Automated Data Updates**: Continuous monitoring and extraction of new TechGyant articles

## Mission
Empower African tech ecosystem growth by connecting promising startups with global investors through data-driven insights.

## Real TechGyant Data
This project uses **pure real data extracted from TechGyant articles** featuring:
- **16+ verified African tech startups** (Flutterwave, M-KOPA, Moove, Lemfi, etc.)
- **Automated extraction** from https://techgyant.com/articles/
- **Continuous updates** when new articles are published
- **Rich features** including funding data, team info, market alignment, and more
- **No synthetic data** - only authentic startup information

### Sample Startups in Dataset:
- ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ **Flutterwave** - FinTech (Digital Payment) - $500M funding
- ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª **M-KOPA** - FinTech (Financial Inclusion) - $265M funding  
- ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ **Moove** - FinTech (Supply Chain) - $600M funding
- ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¼ **Ampersand** - CleanTech (Energy Access) - $21.5M funding
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­ **Kofa** - CleanTech (Energy Access) - $8M funding
